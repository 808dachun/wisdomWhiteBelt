<h1>Take Your Opponent To The Ground</h1>

<p>"The first outlook is that the ground phase is the best place to take a single-combat weaponless fight, since this is where the greatest degree of positiponal control is possible. This is the means by which a fighter can negate an opponent's stricking offense and by which he can set up submissiom hold to allow the fight to brew on efficiently"
